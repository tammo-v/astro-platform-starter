# Architecture 

Adaptive Symbolic Notation (ASN) defines the execution model that powers Symbolic Computing. It allows symbolic expressions to remain structurally intact across transformation, memory, and execution — enabling compositional workflows that are reusable, inspectable, and precisely evaluable.

ASN is built for execution on symbolic form. Rather than reducing expressions into numeric values early, it allows values to stay symbolic — grouped, tagged, and routed based on structure. Evaluation occurs only when required, typically at the boundary or output stage.

This model supports symbolic workflows across fields such as simulation, cryptography, matrix transformation, and symbolic audio — all without flattening expressions into traditional numeric form.

### Core Execution Behaviors

ASN defines a symbolic execution model based on the following behaviors:

- **Suffix-Based Tagging**  
  Symbolic suffixes encode sign, phase, axis, or execution role. These guide grouping, transformation, and routing during execution.

- **Symbolic Referencing**  
  Expressions remain memory-resident and structurally intact. They can be reused, recombined, or composed without duplication.

- **Symbolic Grouping**  
  Values and expressions can be grouped into compositional units — such as matrix blocks, rational sequences, or transformation chains — and executed together.

- **Symbolic Dispatch**  
  Execution is routed based on tags and structure, rather than fixed instruction flow.

- **Controlled Evaluation**  
  Evaluation is triggered by structural context. Until then, expressions remain symbolic, preserving compositional identity across stages.

### Execution Across Domains

ASN is domain-agnostic. It allows symbolic operations to proceed through structure, not through code paths. Applications include:

- Symbolic matrix transformation  
- Cryptographic pipelines  
- Scientific modeling  
- Structured audio and signal processing

ASN is implemented in software, and may also extend into symbolic hardware. Its architecture is general-purpose — supporting symbolic workflows at scale.
