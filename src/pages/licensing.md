## Licensing

Symbolic Computing is a structural framework for systems design. We do not manufacture hardware or deploy end-user systems. Instead, we define the underlying architecture that enables those systems to exist.

The foundational MAR patents—covering symbolic memory, matrix computation, and semantic execution—have been filed and are pending publication. These patents describe a symbolic model with applications across artificial intelligence, encryption and security protocols, software systems, hardware design and SPU development, simulation platforms, and infrastructure.

We are developing a flexible licensing model designed to support academic institutions, research groups, commercial ventures, and infrastructure developers. Licensing allows us to share this work in a way that is open, yet structured—ensuring the architecture is applied with coherence while remaining accessible to those who wish to build on it. You are welcome to contact us if you are looking to:

- license existing symbolic components  
- develop new intellectual property based on our architecture  
- explore technical collaboration around symbolic computation

If you are interested in licensing, please include in your message (optional but helpful):

- Your application domain  
- Intended use or symbolic area of interest  
- Your organization or context
