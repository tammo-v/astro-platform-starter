## Device-Rooted Trust

Symbolic Computing is developing a suite of patents that define the substrate of digital trust.  
This framework moves beyond passwords, tokens, and certificates, introducing a consistent device-based approach to authentication across all domains.  

Our current work focuses on authentication in:  

- **Networks** (Wi-Fi and enterprise access)  
- **Peer-to-peer connections** (Bluetooth, NFC, UWB)  
- **IoT devices** (consumer and industrial)  
- **Physical access** (cars, homes, enterprises, hospitality)  
- **Web services** (online interactions between users and platforms)  
- **Accounts** (identity management for consumers and enterprises)  
- **Transactions** (purchases, subscriptions, and fulfillment)  
- **Service-to-service** (trust between backend systems and APIs)  

Each patent stands on its own but also contributes to a unified architecture for trust.

## Patents

Together, these eight patents define a single, coherent substrate for authentication, rooted in the device, mediated by the operating system, and extensible across domains.
