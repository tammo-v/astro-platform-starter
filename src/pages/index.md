## Device-Rooted Trust

Symbolic Computing is developing a suite of patents that define the substrate of digital trust.  This framework replaces passwords, tokens, and certificates with secure, hardware-backed proofs that operate consistently across all domains of authentication.  

Our current work focuses on authentication, spanning:  

- **Networks** (Wi-Fi and enterprise access)  
- **Peer-to-peer connections** (Bluetooth, NFC, UWB)  
- **IoT devices** (consumer and industrial)  
- **Physical access** (cars, homes, enterprises, hotels)  
- **Web services** (reciprocal authentication at the handshake)  
- **Accounts** (device-based identity for consumers and enterprises)  
- **Checkout** (an OS-level shopping basket consolidating purchases and subscriptions)  
- **Service-to-service** (mutual proof between APIs and backend systems)  

Each patent stands on its own but also contributes to a unified architecture for trust.

## Patents

The first set of provisional patents defines decentralized authentication using device-generated keys and direct identity confirmation.
