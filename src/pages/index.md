## Advancing the Foundations of Computing

Symbolic Computing is developing a portfolio of patents that explore new architectures, protocols, and execution models for the next generation of computing.  

Our work spans multiple domains — from authentication and security to new approaches for computation itself. Each patent is designed to stand on its own, while contributing to a broader, long-term vision.  

Our first public release is **SEAL**: a decentralized authentication model that replaces passwords and vendor accounts with device-based cryptographic identity. It is built entirely from known cryptographic primitives, configured in a new way to remove central points of control while improving security.  

More patents will follow, each addressing different layers of the computing stack.
