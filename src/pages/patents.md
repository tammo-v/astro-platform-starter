## Patent Structure

The Symbolic Computing framework is currently organized into three verticals: Structured Intelligence, Video, and Audio. Each vertical consists of structurally independent components, designed to operate as a coherent system when combined. Additional verticals will follow as the symbolic substrate expands.

The following titles represent the current structure.

---

## Foundations

**F1** — Symbolic Matrix Fields for Symbolic Computing

---

## Structured Intelligence

**S1** — Symbolic Language Model Execution (LLM)  
**S2** — Symbolic Program Construction  
**S3** — Symbolic Agent Execution Model

---

## Interface

**I1** — Symbolic Agent Operating System  
**I2** — Symbolic Agent Execution in Software Interfaces  
**I3** — Symbolic Agent Execution in Web Interfaces

---

## Video

**V1** — Symbolic Photo and Video Matrix Field Initialization  
**V2** — Symbolic Object Identity in Photo and Video  
**V3** — Symbolic Video Compression and Playback  
**V4** — Symbolic Agent Execution in Visual Composition and Photo Interfaces  
**V5** — Symbolic Agent Execution in Video Interfaces  
**V6** — Symbolic Video Camera

---

## Audio

**A1** — Symbolic Audio Matrix Field Initialization  
**A2** — Symbolic Sound Identity  
**A3** — Symbolic Audio Compression and Playback  
**A4** — Symbolic Agent Execution in Audio Interfaces  
**A5** — Symbolic Speech Recognition and Generation  
**A6** — Symbolic Noise Cancellation  
**A7** — Symbolic Audio Recording and Microphone  
**A8** — Symbolic Speakers and Headphones

---

## Cryptography
