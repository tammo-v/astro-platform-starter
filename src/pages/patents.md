## Patent Structure

All patents in this portfolio are built on a single architectural system: the symbolic matrix field.

Each patent defines how this structure operates in a specific domain—applying the same logic of symbolic tokens, referential fields, and agent-based execution to intelligence, visual media, runtime systems, navigation, and cryptography.

These are not isolated technologies. They are high-level structural patents: modular applications of a unified execution model. Because the architecture is recursive, the same logic applies across domains. What follows is not a collection of systems—but one system, expressed through multiple symbolic fields.
