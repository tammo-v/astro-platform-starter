## Patent Structure

The Symbolic Computing framework is currently organized into three verticals: Artificial Intelligence, Video, and Audio. Each vertical consists of structurally independent components, designed to operate as a coherent system when combined. Additional verticals will follow as the symbolic substrate expands.

The following titles represent the current structure.

## Artificial Intelligence

**S1** — Symbolic Program Matrix Field Initialization (Consumer)  
**S2** — Symbolic Program Matrix Field Initialization (Enterprise)  
**S3** — Symbolic Program Construction  
**S4** — Symbolic Agent OS
**S5** — Symbolic LLM

## Video

**V1** — Symbolic Photo and Video Matrix Field Initialization  
**V2** — Symbolic Object Identity in Photo and Video  
**V3** — Symbolic Photo  
**V4** — Symbolic Video Compression and Playback  
**V5** — Symbolic Video Recording and Editing  
**V6** — Symbolic Video Synthesis  
**V7** — Symbolic Video Camera

## Audio

**A1** — Symbolic Audio Matrix Field Initialization  
**A2** — Symbolic Sound Identity  
**A3** — Symbolic Audio Compression and Playback  
**A4** — Symbolic Audio Editing and Composition  
**A5** — Symbolic Speech Recognition and Generation  
**A6** — Symbolic Audio Synthesis  
**A7** — Symbolic Noise Cancellation
