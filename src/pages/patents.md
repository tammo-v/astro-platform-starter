## Authentication Patent Structure

Symbolic Computing’s current work is organized around a single parent patent
defining a device-rooted authentication architecture based on device-delegated
cryptographic authorization.

The parent architecture applies across multiple trust domains. The sections
below describe the primary domain areas in which the same underlying model is
embodied, rather than separate or independent inventions.

---

### Part A — Wireless and Physical Authentication

- **A1. Device-Rooted Network Authentication**  
  Device-based access to Wi-Fi and wired networks without shared credentials or
  certificate infrastructure.

- **A2. Device-Rooted Peer Authentication**  
  Stronger trust for peripherals and peer devices, integrated into familiar
  pairing workflows.

- **A3. Device-Rooted IoT Authentication**  
  Secure onboarding and lifecycle control for consumer and industrial connected
  devices, including headless systems.

- **A4. Device-Rooted Physical Authentication**  
  Using personal devices as cryptographic keys for vehicles, buildings, and
  hospitality environments.

### Part B — Online Authentication

- **B1. Device-Rooted Service Authentication**  
  Extending device-rooted trust into online service interactions through
  reciprocal authentication.

- **B2. Device-Rooted Account Authentication**  
  A consistent, device-based model for account identity and continuity across
  platforms.

- **B3. Service-to-Service Authentication**  
  Cryptographic trust between backend systems, APIs, and agentic AI services,
  using the same device-delegated authorization model.

Together, these domain areas illustrate how a single device-rooted
authentication architecture can be applied consistently across physical and
online environments.
