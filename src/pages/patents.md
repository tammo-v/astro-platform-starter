## Authentication Patent Suite

Symbolic Computing’s first portfolio consists of eight provisional patents, together defining a single substrate for authentication.  

Each addresses a specific vertical but relies on the same model: device-rooted keys, secure hardware, and mutual cryptographic proof at the moment of access.

### Part A — Wireless Authentication

- **A1. Device-Rooted Network Authentication**  
  Passwordless Wi-Fi/Ethernet access, with authentication inseparable from association.  

- **A2. Device-Rooted Peer Authentication**  
  Secure pairing for peripherals; no “connected but not authenticated” states; theft-proof by design.  

- **A3. Device-Rooted IoT Authentication**  
  Cryptographic onboarding and lifecycle control for devices at home and in enterprise/industry.  

- **A4. Device-Rooted Physical Authentication**  
  “Your device is your key” for cars, offices, hospitality, and home—OS-mediated and revocable.

### Part B — Online Authentication

- **B1. Device-Rooted Service Authentication**  
  Reciprocity at the first handshake—devices prove themselves to services as services prove themselves to devices.  

- **B2. Device-Rooted Account Authentication**  
  “Your account is your devices”—login as local proof; passwords and resets disappear.  

- **B3. Device-Rooted Transaction Orchestration**  
  OS-level shopping basket—payments, subscriptions, fulfillment as a single signed authorization.  

- **B4. Device-to-Service Authentication**  
  Mutual proof and verifiable receipts for backend/API traffic.

Taken together, these eight provisional patents establish the foundation for device-rooted trust. Each stands alone in its domain, but the true value emerges in combination: a unified authentication substrate that can scale across services, enterprises, and consumer ecosystems. This portfolio forms the first phase of a broader architecture, with further patents to follow as the work extends into adjacent domains.
