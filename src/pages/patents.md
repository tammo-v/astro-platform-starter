## Authentication Patent Suite

Symbolic Computing’s first portfolio consists of eight provisional patents, together defining a unified framework for authentication.  

Each addresses a different vertical but relies on the same underlying substrate, ensuring consistency across services, devices, networks, and transactions.

---

### Part A — Wireless Authentication

- **A1. Device-Rooted Network Authentication**  
  Seamless access to Wi-Fi and wired networks, anchored directly in the device.  

- **A2. Device-Rooted Peer Authentication**  
  Stronger trust for peripherals and peer devices, built into everyday pairing.  

- **A3. Device-Rooted IoT Authentication**  
  Secure onboarding and lifecycle management for connected devices, at home or in industry.  

- **A4. Device-Rooted Physical Authentication**  
  Turning personal devices into keys for cars, buildings, and hospitality.  

---

### Part B — Online Authentication

- **B1. Device-Rooted Service Authentication**  
  Extending device trust into the way services are accessed online.  

- **B2. Device-Rooted Account Authentication**  
  A consistent model for accounts and identity, spanning devices and platforms.  

- **B3. Device-Rooted Transaction Orchestration**  
  A unified approach to purchases, subscriptions, and fulfillment.  

- **B4. Device-to-Service Authentication**  
  Strengthening trust between backend systems and APIs.

Taken together, these eight provisional patents establish the foundation for device-rooted trust. Each stands alone in its domain, but the true value emerges in combination: a unified authentication substrate that can scale across services, enterprises, and consumer ecosystems. This portfolio forms the first phase of a broader architecture, with further patents to follow as the work extends into adjacent domains.
