## Symbolic Software Layer

The **Symbolic Software Layer** is the runtime environment in which symbolic programs are composed, interpreted, and executed. It is built directly on top of ISUs, ISEs, and IRDs, and operates without reducing symbolic form into procedural code.

In classical systems, software operates through instruction sequences — ordered commands that modify memory, resolve expressions, or trigger function calls. Symbolic software operates differently. It treats computation as a transformation of form, not a progression of steps.

Symbolic programs are composed from ISUs and ISEs. They express logic in structured form: symbolic units grouped into expressions, routed through memory, and transformed by symbolic rules. These programs are written in Symbolic Programming Languages (SPLs), which encode logic using symbolic structure rather than syntax.

Execution does not follow control flow. It follows composition.

Symbolic flow is governed by the **Symbolic Execution and Memory Stack (SEMS)**. All evaluation, deferral, transformation, and reuse happens structurally — within SEMS. There are no registers, stacks, or instruction pointers in the traditional sense. Instead, symbolic expressions are traversed, labeled, grouped, or restructured based on identity and form.

**Core functions of the Symbolic Software Layer:**

- Interpret symbolic programs written in SPL  
- Preserve form across execution: no flattening of expressions  
- Invoke ADM to determine symbolic flow paths  
- Coordinate memory routing via SEMS  
- Enable reuse through IRDs and symbolic reference

The symbolic software layer also supports deferred evaluation. Expressions are preserved until symbolic context calls for resolution. This allows for symbolic caching, introspection, and recomposition — all without loss of form.

**Example:**  
A symbolic program defines a rule:

> `If phase(x) = p, then promote(x)`

This rule is not compiled. It is preserved as a symbolic object — tagged, stored, and activated by ADM when a matching structure appears. Symbolic execution applies it structurally, not procedurally.

Symbolic software can be deployed on classical machines. It emulates the full MAR architecture in software, using current CPUs and memory. Programs are parsed, structured, and routed symbolically — even in environments that do not natively support symbolic execution.

The symbolic software layer makes MAR operational before symbolic hardware is available. It allows symbolic programs to run today — not as simulations, but as direct executions on preserved form.
